    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All four hypotheses were validated**, confirming our initial insights from EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geographic concentration** is extreme - risk mitigation can focus on specific regions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activity-based targeting** for safety campaigns is justified - surfing/swimming education is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Demographic patterns** are clear - young males engaged in water sports are highest risk group\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal increase** is dramatic but likely reflects better reporting rather than increased danger\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Implications:\n",
    "- Insurance products can be geographically and demographically targeted\n",
    "- Safety equipment marketing should focus on surfers and swimmers\n",
    "- Education programs should target young male demographics\n",
    "- Historical trend data supports growing market for shark-related safety products"
