    "   - Emergency response equipment (tourniquets, communication devices)\n",
    "   - Monitoring/alert systems for high-risk areas\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Market Expansion**\n",
    "   - Prioritize low-risk coastal markets for surf shops\n",
    "   - USA remains viable despite high volume (low fatality, large market)\n",
    "   - Avoid very high-risk markets unless premium positioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Research & Policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve Data Collection**\n",
    "   - Standardize reporting across countries\n",
    "   - Better species identification protocols\n",
    "   - Track environmental factors (water temp, season, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Medical Response**\n",
    "   - Emergency response time is critical to survival\n",
    "   - Invest in coastal medical infrastructure\n",
    "   - Train lifeguards in shark attack first aid\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prevention Research**\n",
    "   - Study shark behavior and deterrent effectiveness\n",

    "## 5. Limitations & Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Limitations:\n",
    "- **Reporting bias:** Developed countries have better data infrastructure\n",
    "- **Survivorship bias:** Non-fatal attacks more likely to be documented\n",
    "- **Historical data:** Early records less reliable and complete\n",
    "- **Species identification:** Difficult in attack situations, many unconfirmed\n",
    "- **Activity classification:** Inconsistent categorization across records\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Analysis Opportunities:\n",
    "1. **Time series forecasting** of attack trends by region\n",
    "2. **Environmental factor analysis** (water temperature, shark populations, seasonality)\n",
    "3. **Machine learning models** for risk prediction\n",

    "## 6. Final Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis of 7,000+ shark attacks spanning over a century reveals clear, actionable patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ All Hypotheses Validated:\n",
    "Our data-driven approach confirmed all four initial hypotheses, demonstrating that shark attacks exhibit predictable patterns based on:\n",
    "- Geography (concentrated in 3 countries)\n",
    "- Activity type (surfing/swimming highest risk)\n",
    "- Demographics (young adult males)\n",
    "- Time period (increasing over decades)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Practical Implications:\n",
    "1. **Risk is concentrated and predictable** - enabling targeted interventions\n",
    "2. **Most attacks are survivable** - medical response is critical\n",
    "3. **Market exists for safety products** - clear target demographic and use cases\n",
    "4. **Geographic variation matters** - one-size-fits-all approaches won't work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Insight:\n",
    "While shark attacks are increasing in absolute numbers, this primarily reflects:\n",
    "- Growing coastal populations and tourism\n",
    "- Increased participation in water sports\n",
    "- Better reporting and data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The **actual risk per ocean exposure** may be stable or even declining. Shark attacks remain extremely rare events relative to the millions of people who safely enjoy ocean activities annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Recommended Action:\n",
    "Focus on **evidence-based prevention** rather than fear-based messaging. The data shows clear patterns that can inform:\n",
    "- Where to deploy resources\n",
    "- Who to target with education\n",
    "- What activities need safety enhancements\n",
    "- How to price risk appropriately\n",
